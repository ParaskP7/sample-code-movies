# Sample Code: Movies

This repository contains sample code. 

Its purpose being, to quickly demonstrate Android, Kotlin and software development in general. More so and amongst others, 
the main focus of this project is:
- Setup and Gradle configuration, 
- Gradle modules,
- Clean architecture,
- Clean code,
- Best practices,
- Testing and 
- All those other must know goodies.

Below is a list of goodies that are being showcased:

1. Architectural Pattern
    1. [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) ```(By employing 
    clean architecture, you can design applications with very low coupling and independent of technical implementation 
    details, such as databases and frameworks. That way, the application becomes easy to maintain and flexible to change. 
    It also becomes intrinsically testable.)```

# Usage

The first thing that you need to do in order to be able to build this project is to obtain your personal keys and place them 
under the below config directory:
```
config/keys/
```

With the current configuration the build will be completed successful. However, in order for you to play with the app you 
will need to obtain your personal api key from "The Movie Database" and replace the existing mocked api key with yours 
within the below property file:
```
themoviedb_api.properties
```

For more information on how to obtain your personal TMDB api key visit  
[The Movie Database API (v3)](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

After this, you might want to ignore this change and make git forget all about that. In order to do so, run the below git 
command:
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged config/keys/themoviedb_api.properties
```

# Build Variant

This project is setup in a way that can be configured to filter out on demand specific build variants by just specifying the 
'ignored_variants' property, which is located within the 'local.properties' file. If no configuration is specified, then the 
default configuration will be applied, which is all build types and flavors.

To apply this configuration first locate the 'local.properties' file, and if it doesn't exist already, create it. Then, add 
the 'ignored_variants' property and assign that to a value. This value can be a single variant value, such as the 'release' 
built type or a comma separated list of variant values, such as 'debug,release,etc'. Any variant that goes in there will be 
then filtered out by the build.
```
This is mainly done in order to speed up build times and complexity during development, thus making developers happier since 
in most cases developers usually only care about the'debug' build type (and a single build flavor, if that is even available).
```

# Building The Project

All set, use the below command to build the project in order to install it on an Android device for demonstration:
```
gradlew clean build -x check
```

Or faster yet and targeting a specific build type (in our case the debug build type):
```
gradlew clean assembleDebug
```

Open an emulator or connect a physical device to experiment with the sample app, use the below command, which first 
uninstalls and then installs the sample app:
```
gradlew uninstallDebug | gradlew installDebug
```

Or faster yet, target a specific device (in our case an emulator):
```
adb -s emulator-5554 uninstall io.petros.movies | 
adb -s emulator-5554 install app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

Use this command in order to run the static code analysis for the project:
```
gradlew check -x test
```

Or if you want to be more specific, run the below commands to run the code quality tool or your choice (in isolation):
```
gradlew detekt
gradlew lintDebug
```

Run the project unit tests using this command (this includes Robolectric):
```
gradlew test
```

Or if you want to be more specific, run the below commands to run the tests or your choice (per module):
```
gradlew <kotlin_module>:test
gradlew <android_module>:testDebugUnitTest
```

Run the project instrumentation tests using this command (Espresso):
```
gradlew app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

Use this command in order to check dependency updates for the project:
```
gradlew dependencyUpdates
```

# Future

Below is a list of all those ```I WISH I HAD MORE TIME TO DO``` future technical enhancements:
1. Espresso tests (preferable with the Robot pattern). See `MET` comment which stands for `Missing Espresso Tests`
2. Integration tests (preferable with MockWebServer). See `MIT` comment which stands for `Missing Integration Tests`
3. Add missing Robolectric tests. See `MRT` comment which stands for `Missing Robolectric Tests`
4. Add missing Unit tests. See `MUT` comment which stands for `Missing Unit Tests`
5. Small, medium and large screen considerations.
6. UI changes during screen rotations (edge cases).
7. Other lifecycle related edge case events.

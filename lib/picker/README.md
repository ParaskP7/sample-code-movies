# Lib: Picker

This module is based on the [Monthandyearpicker](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.whiteelephant/monthandyearpicker) library.
Month and Year Picker allow user to pick only month and year or only month or only year as required. You will get
notified for all action's such as on selection of date, on selection of month and on section of year.

The [Monthandyearpicker](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.whiteelephant/monthandyearpicker) library  hasn't been
updated since September 2018. As such, it is getting old and it slowly becomes legacy.

More importantly, with this library as a dependency to any project, the jetifier cannot be dropped. As such, all the
code and resources within the [Monthandyearpicker](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.whiteelephant/monthandyearpicker)
has been extracted from it and moved under this repo's `io.petros.movies.picker.lib` package, where it will live and be
maintained from now on.

A lot of improvements where performed to this library after it was migrated. However, there will be lots more to come,
like Kotlinizing all classes.
